An interactive game suite developed to assist stroke survivors and individuals with fine motor skill impairments through engaging, goal-oriented digital activities.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project was built as part of an Arizona State University capstone course (Team 4) with the goal of supporting stroke survivors in regaining fine motor control for everyday tasks such as eating, brushing teeth, and handwriting. The application includes four custom-built browser games, each targeting different aspects of hand-eye coordination and motor precision.

## 🎮 Game Descriptions

Each game is built using **p5.js** and runs in the browser.

| Game | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Hoops** | A basketball shooting game where the user must aim and score. Helps improve click-and-drag precision and hand coordination. |
| **Hockey** | A digital air hockey game for puck handling and reflex training. Great for improving swift hand movement. |
| **Balloon Cut** | A slicing game where players cut floating balloons under time pressure — good for refining small object interaction. |
| **Time Tiles** | A reaction-timing game where players must hit tiles accurately within a countdown, helping with timing and key control. |
